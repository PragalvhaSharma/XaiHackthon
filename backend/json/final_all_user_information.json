We aim to deploy a self-improving agent that updates itself with the feedback, and recruiting is a start point. :sparkles:\n\n*Description*\n_\"If you have a model that learns like a human, and you deploy millions of instances across the economy, they can learn on the job and merge their knowledge. This creates a functional superintelligence...\"_ \u2014 Ilya Sutskever\nAs Ilya recently posited, the path to superintelligence may not rely solely on scaling post-training, but on creating a \"superintelligent learner\"\u2014a model capable of \"learning on the job\". Thus, starting from recruiting, we hope to create production-grade tools that act like a recruiting tool: identify, evaluate, and engage engineering and research talent using Grok models; at the same time, leveraging feedback from humans and self update the policy gradient or context space. We generally encourage having the *\u201clearning from deployment\u201d* idea, and projects should focus on talent sourcing (GitHub, X, arXiv, linkedin, etc.), personalized outreach sequencing, technical assessment generation, interview scheduling, reference checking, or full-cycle candidate relationship management. Strong submissions typically demonstrate measurable precision/recall against real hiring benchmarks.\n\n*Example project ideas*\n\u2022 Passive candidate sourcer that surfaces under-the-radar engineers from public code/repos/posts \n\u2022 Utilize X api to build Graph database of talents and as a customized tool for Grok Recruiter to source from connection graph\n\u2022 Automated reference checker that conducts 15-minute voice calls and summarizes signals\n\u2022 Role-specific technical screening bot that generates and evaluates coding/behavioral exercises - have similar online RL approach such as cursor tab that automatically generate meaningful question\n\u2022 Candidate database, across the full process of hiring (material screening, phone screening, technical interview, presentation &amp; teammatching), build LLM friendly context database - such as MemOS style memory system update \nMore details in the channel. :technologist:",

At first I was thinking to work on anything but ads, but I am actually thinking Ads might be the most interesting track (ask me in person). Hopefully we get access to Grok 4 Heavy for this (right, <@U09VAAA2KU2>, we get the best Grok?). Would also be great to have access to X firehose (the enterprise plan) for the weekend.\n\nAnyway, I am actually not even sure what \u201cteams\u201d mean in the age of AI. The AI is better at coding than all of us combined. Maybe we can find a way to be useful as a group in some other aspects?\n\nIf you want to see everyone currently posting in this channel in one place, here\u2019s the list:\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G_jhGRReU3QxHgC19rOdAhjCopSaJEajorBSvkPWdts/edit?usp=sharing>",

Really interested in using Grok for accessibility, (thinking tools for visually impaired users like real-time scene descriptions or navigation assistance), since I feel like AI could genuinely make a difference there. Also down for anything around agentic frameworks or creative tools if someone\u2019s got a cool idea going. I\u2019m comfortable with backend/systems stuff and can jump into full-stack if needed. Would love to collaborate with teammates who want to build something technically interesting that\u2019s also useful.",

Maybe a framework to plug & play Grok into different games/decision making situations (Minecraft, WBWWB, ChatGPT Agent)? Something along the lines of Apple Visual Intelligence (or a widget for Grok-powered on-screen intelligence) seems cool too.\nLooking For: People with similar interests + a good background in programming or MLE, good mix between collaboration & autonomy, similar interests/cool ideas in a similar space.
